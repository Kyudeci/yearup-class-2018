            Sudowoodo has a brown, log-shaped body with yellow spots. It has short legs with toeless feet and thin forelegs with three green spheres at the ends. It has a forked "branch" on top of its head, which is shorter on the female than on the male. Despite its appearance, Sudowoodo's composition is closer to a rock than a plant.</p>

        <p style="font-size:12px; padding-right: 150px; padding-left: 150px">One of Electrode's characteristics is its attraction to electricity. It is a problematical Pok√©mon that congregates mostly at electrical power plants to feed on electricity that has just been generated.</p>
